<h2 style="margin-top:-15px";>Overview:<br>
</h2>
<p align="justify"; style="margin-top:-10px";color="black">
The rapid advancement in electronics, embedded systems, wireless communications and computer software applications over the last decade led to the development of the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The IoT is a blend of all these technologies that provides interconnection and interoperations of millions of devices with ubiquitous computing and communications, thus providing the infrastructure for ‘smartness’ in the things. The recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has enabled diverse smart IoT applications, starting from the smart phone to smart home, smart city, smart healthcare, smart transportation and many others. This course will introduce the technology enablers of the IoT with the state-of-the-art computing and communication technologies where the students will learn the end-to-end pipeline including sensing, data acquisition, local data processing, communications, data management and analytics at the cloud. The course is designed for students to learn about the most recent cutting-edge technologies which will help students for their next career in industry or in their further academic research.
